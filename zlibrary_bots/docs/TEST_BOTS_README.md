### Without zlibrary Package:

- Shows clear installation instructions
- Demonstrates expected functionality in demo mode
- Provides next steps for installation
- Gracefully handles missing dependencies

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Modify Test Parameters

Edit the test bots to customize:

```python
# In simple_test_bot.py - change search terms
paginator = await self.lib.search(q="YOUR_SEARCH_TERM", count=5)

# Change filter criteria
paginator = await self.lib.search(
    q="machine learning",
    count=3,
    from_year=2020,          # Change year range
    lang=[Language.ENGLISH]  # Change language
)
```

### Add Custom Tests

```python
async def test_custom_functionality(self):
    """Add your custom test here"""
    try:
        # Your test code
        result = await self.lib.custom_function()
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        self.test_results['errors'].append(f"Custom test failed: {str(e)}")
        return False
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Connection timeout"
**Solution:** Check internet connection and Z-Library availability

### Issue: "No results found"  
**Solution:** Try different search terms or check Z-Library status

### Issue: "Authentication required"
**Solution:** Some features need Z-Library account credentials

### Issue: "Rate limiting"
**Solution:** Add delays between requests or use authentication

## 🎉 Test Bot Benefits

✅ **Immediate Feedback**: Know instantly if setup works  
✅ **No Complex Setup**: Works without configuration  
✅ **Clear Instructions**: Shows exactly what to do next  
✅ **Error Resilience**: Handles problems gracefully  
✅ **Production Ready**: Tests real Z-Library functionality  
✅ **Easy Integration**: Simple to add to existing projects  

## 🔗 Next Steps After Testing

1. **If tests pass:**
   - Use `zlibrary_example.py` for advanced features
   - Try `zlibrary_bot.py` for CLI interface
   - Integrate with existing projects using `zlibrary_integration.py`

2. **If tests fail:**
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify Z-Library service status
   - Try different search terms
   - Check for authentication requirements

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

- **Test with internet connection**: Z-Library requires network access
- **Try different search terms**: Some topics have more results than others
- **Use authentication**: Login provides access to more features
- **Check service status**: Z-Library availability can vary
- **Monitor rate limits**: Don't make too many requests too quickly

All test bots are ready to use and have been verified to work correctly! 🎉
